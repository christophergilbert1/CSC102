        <h2>About Robotics and Embedded Systems</h2>
        <p>Robots and connected embedded digital systems provide smart solutions that extend human capabilities. Powered by artificial intelligence and real-time data generated by nature, people, and the systems within robots and drones, the degrees of autonomy surrounding us increase as they perform valued tasks.</p>
        <p>UATâ€™s Robotics and Embedded Systems (RES) degree provides students with the foundation for the design, implementation, and analysis of embedded systems that make robots, drones, and other platforms viable tools. The RES degree incorporates mechanical design, digital logic design, embedded programming, machine vision, sensing, big data, and artificial intelligence into the development and design of robotic systems that solve useful problems.</p>
